# Keto-Diet-SQL-DB
Used MySQL to create a DB full of recipes for a Keto-friendly diet (Low Carbs)

Objective: Practice MySQL commands in conjunction to GitHub.

First Commit: I learned that default files that MySQL stores the DB in is .ibd.

Second Commit: Manually made the 2 Tables with the 'Send to SQL Editor' on MySQL Workbench and saved it as a .sql. However, I could not
do the same with the existing data in the columns. 

Third Commit: I exported my DB/a Data Dump with the following options: "Dump Structure and Data" and "Export to Self Contained File"
